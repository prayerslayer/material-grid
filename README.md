# material-grid

Responsive grid following[1] the [Material Design spec](https://material.io/guidelines/layout/responsive-ui.html). Also "Bootstrap compatible" in the sense that it's built on flexbox (you can use all of Bootstrap's flexbox utility classes) and has similiar class names.

## TODO

* Classes used for reordering: offset, push, pull https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/mixins/_grid.scss#L69
* Make gutter behavior consistent

## Footnotes

[1] To the extent reasonably possible.
